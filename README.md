# Resume

Hello! My name is Eliott Lacomme Ruiz and I am currently a Junior at Northwestern Univerisy studying electrical engineering. 

This is my project repository. Each of my projects have their own writeups (as pdfs) that have detailed information on how they were designed and built. Thank you for taking a look and enjoy!
